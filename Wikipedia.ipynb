Fred claimed to be Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II; Donald Trump also claimed Swedish heritage until 1990. Trump\\'s mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Scotland. Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.

Trump has told the press his tax rate is none of their business, and that he tries to pay \"as little tax as possible\".',\n",
       " 'Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.',\n",

Trump publicly threatened to attack Iranian cultural sites, or react \"in a disproportionate manner\" if Iran retaliated; though such attacks by the U.S. would violate international law as war crimes. On January 8, Iran retaliated by launching airstrikes on Al Asad Air Base in Iraq; initially the Trump administration claimed no Americans suffered injuries, then Trump said injuries were not \"very serious\", but by February 2020, more than a hundred traumatic brain injuries were diagnosed in U.S. troops. Iran issues an arrest warrant for 36 U.S. political and military officials, including President Trump, for their role in the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.',\n",

       " 'Trump has repeatedly praised Russian president Vladimir Putin; criticism of Putin by Trump was uncommon. As a presidential candidate, Trump continually reiterated that Putin is a strong leader. When Putin in August 2017 expelled over half of the staff of the American embassy in Russia in retaliation for Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which imposed new sanctions on Russia, President Trump responded by thanking Putin, saying \"We\\'ll save a lot of money,\" instead of criticizing him. After Trump met Putin at the Helsinki Summit on July 16, 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for siding with Putin\\'s denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.',\n",
       " 'In early May, President Trump proposed that the coronavirus task force should be phased out, to accommodate another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump publicly said the coronavirus task force would continue on \"indefinitely\". By the end of May, the coronavirus task force\\'s meetings were sharply reduced.',\n",
       " \"In a Rose Garden speech on June 1, 2020, President Trump said he would deploy the U.S. military to stop violence if a city or state refused to do so, and declared himself the ally of peaceful protestors,  following the police killing of George Floyd. While he was speaking, federal law enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd from Lafayette Square, outside the White House. The removal had been ordered by Attorney General William Barr. Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church where the night before a small fire had been set in the basement nursery of its parish house. He posed for photographs holding a Bible, with Cabinet members and other officials later joining him in photos. Trump, who had attended services at the church three times since taking office, did not enter the church or inspect the damage to the basement.\",\n",
       " 'The Crossfire Hurricane FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in mid-2016 during the campaign season. Since he assumed the presidency, Trump has been the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation. The New York Times reported in May 2019 that there were 29 open investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and eleven Congressional investigations. In 2020, Jeffrey Toobin authored a book entitled, True Crimes and Misdemeanors, the Investigation of Donald Trump, which is described as a condensation of evidence against Trump, as if he were on trial.',\n",
       " 'On May 17, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\", thus taking over the existing \"Crossfire Hurricane\" FBI investigation into the matter. The special counsel also investigated whether Trump\\'s dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice, and possible campaign ties to other national governments. Trump repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. Mueller also investigated the Trump campaign\\'s possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.',\n",
       " 'The second volume of the Mueller Report dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The report did not exonerate Trump of obstruction inasmuch as investigators were not confident of his innocence after examining his intent and actions. Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\", as they could not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\". Congress subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump–Ukraine scandal, albeit it ultimately did not press charges related to the Mueller investigation.',\n",
       " \"After the whistleblower complaint became known in September 2019, House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24. The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate and to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. According to the testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials, the events were part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.\",\n",
       " 'On December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that \"the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.\" The report said Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump\\'s political rivals. Furthermore, the report described Trump was the only U.S. president thus far to have \"openly and indiscriminately\" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony.:8,208 The Republicans of the House Committees had released a draft of a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence \"does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats\\' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.\"',\n",
       " 'Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including the Barack Obama \"birther\" theory, the Clinton body count theory, conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal and QAnon. A July 2020 video asserting conspiracy theories about coronavirus by Stella Immanuel, a Texas physician, was retweeted by Trump before it was removed from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube because it violated their rules on misinformation. At a press conference on July 28 he was asked why he would trust Immanuel, considering the context of her claims about \"alien DNA\" and its supposed use in medicine. Trump defended Immanuel saying, \"I thought she was very impressive, in the sense that, from where she came&#160;&#8211;I don\\'t know what country she comes from&#160;&#8211;but she said that she\\'s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.\" When pressed further about the conflict with existing official medical information about the virus, Trump ended the briefing abruptly.',\n",
       " 'Trump has been the subject of comedians, Flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency.

When Putin in August 2017 expelled over half of the staff of the American embassy in Russia in retaliation for Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which imposed new sanctions on Russia, President Trump responded by thanking Putin, saying \"We\\'ll save a lot of money,\" instead of criticizing him. After Trump met Putin at the Helsinki Summit on July 16, 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for siding with Putin\\'s denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.',\n",
       " 'In early May, President Trump proposed that the coronavirus task force should be phased out, to accommodate another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump publicly said the coronavirus task force would continue on \"indefinitely\". By the end of May, the coronavirus task force\\'s meetings were sharply reduced.',\n",
       " \"In a Rose Garden speech on June 1, 2020, President Trump said he would deploy the U.S. military to stop violence if a city or state refused to do so, and declared himself the ally of peaceful protestors,  following the police killing of George Floyd. While he was speaking, federal law enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd from Lafayette Square, outside the White House. The removal had been ordered by Attorney General William Barr. Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church where the night before a small fire had been set in the basement nursery of its parish house. He posed for photographs holding a Bible, with Cabinet members and other officials later joining him in photos. Trump, who had attended services at the church three times since taking office, did not enter the church or inspect the damage to the basement.\",\n",
       " 'The Crossfire Hurricane FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in mid-2016 during the campaign season. Since he assumed the presidency, Trump has been the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation. The New York Times reported in May 2019 that there were 29 open investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and eleven Congressional investigations. In 2020, Jeffrey Toobin authored a book entitled, True Crimes and Misdemeanors, the Investigation of Donald Trump, which is described as a condensation of evidence against Trump, as if he were on trial.',\n",
       " 'On May 17, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\", thus taking over the existing \"Crossfire Hurricane\" FBI investigation into the matter. The special counsel also investigated whether Trump\\'s dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice, and possible campaign ties to other national governments. Trump repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. Mueller also investigated the Trump campaign\\'s possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.',\n",
       " 'The second volume of the Mueller Report dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The report did not exonerate Trump of obstruction inasmuch as investigators were not confident of his innocence after examining his intent and actions. Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\", as they could not indict a sitting president per an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion, and would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\". Congress subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump–Ukraine scandal, albeit it ultimately did not press charges related to the Mueller investigation.',\n",
       " \"After the whistleblower complaint became known in September 2019, House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24. The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate and to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. According to the testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials, the events were part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.\",\n",
       " 'On December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that \"the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.\" The report said Trump withheld military aid and a White House invitation in order to influence Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump\\'s political rivals. Furthermore, the report described Trump was the only U.S. president thus far to have \"openly and indiscriminately\" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony.:8,208 The Republicans of the House Committees had released a draft of a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence \"does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats\\' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor.\"',\n",
       " 'Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including the Barack Obama \"birther\" theory, the Clinton body count theory, conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal and QAnon. A July 2020 video asserting conspiracy theories about coronavirus by Stella Immanuel, a Texas physician, was retweeted by Trump before it was removed from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube because it violated their rules on misinformation. At a press conference on July 28 he was asked why he would trust Immanuel, considering the context of her claims about \"alien DNA\" and its supposed use in medicine. Trump defended Immanuel saying, \"I thought she was very impressive, in the sense that, from where she came&#160;&#8211;I don\\'t know what country she comes from&#160;&#8211;but she said that she\\'s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.\" When pressed further about the conflict with existing official medical information about the virus, Trump ended the briefing abruptly.',\n",
       " 'Trump has been the subject of comedians, Flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018.']"
