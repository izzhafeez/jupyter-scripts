The sandwich typically consists of either a viena andaluza (an oblong, crusty bread roll) or a mollete (a soft, rustic white bread roll) which is cut in half lengthwise and filled with slices of fried pork tenderloin (lomo de cerdo) and Serrano ham (jamón Serrano), strips of fried green peppers (usually the Italian variety), and tomato slices.\n",

Some food historians claim that this one-pot meal evolved from a peasant dish called olla podrida Manchega, but wasn't named cocido madrileño until the 17th century.\n",

    "However, most sources agree that the famed dish has its roots in the Sephardic stew called adafina–a Shabbat kosher meal based on chickpeas, vegetables, and either hard-boiled eggs or meat such as lamb, veal, beef, or chicken. With the arrival of the Inquisition, feared of prosecution by the Catholic priests who roamed the streets of Madrid at the time–in search of both Jewish and Muslim cookery–the converted Spanish Jews called Marranos started incorporating pork into their adafinas to prove themselves as Christians. \n",
